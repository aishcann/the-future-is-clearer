## Description
The Future is Clearer is a web application built that presents a user with a three-card tarot spread to provide guidance to any question or intention they set. While traditional tarot cards are more atmospheric, this app makes the tarot cards way more portable. No toting around your cards and guidebook, the cards are right on your mobile device.

## Technologies Used
The technologies used in this application are HTML, CSS, JSX and React.  This also uses the Tarot API from [Eleken] (https://github.com/ekelen/tarot-api).

## Getting Started
On this application, you'll start on the homepage.  There are two types of tarot spreads available, and you'll click the button underneath whichever spread you want to try.  Past, Present, and Future provides you a card for each of those areas, providing clarity on a situation, relationship, etc. Mind, Body, Spirit provides you with four cards: three to address your current state, and an additional card that provides on achieving balance.
